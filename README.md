# Rendezvous_App
A simple application that allows students to meet other students on campus in their free time or between lectures.

Think of it like uber. There is the students that want to meet others, they set up their profile containing their bio, interest and answer to miscllaneous questions, then they put themselves out there saying their location, time their free for and request goes out. Like Uber drivers opening themselves to potential client.

Comes in the people that will accept this request ( The riders ) and they'll find a match, request will be process and they'll meet and have a good time. 
App is meant to be used on campus grounds.

As you can probably tell, this is VERY VERY EARLY stage. I still need to layout the requirements of the app, design, technology stack to be used and so on. Feel free to contribute at any stage.

## Requirements

The idea is as follows. I'll be creating an application that is sort of like a mash-up between Uber ( in terms of request and having things time-based, Tinder ( for their card matching ), and OkCupid ( for their heavy personality profiling )
  
### Critical Requirements
- User can sign up with Gmail account
- User can login with registered account
- User should be able sign out of the app
- User will be able to specify abstract interests
- User should be able to edit interests after they're added
- User can upload a single photo ( profile photo )
- User who wants to meet other users will create a request with how their location inside the uni and for how long theyâ€™re free to meet ( 15 min, 30 min ) or from     (1:00 till 1:45) for example.
- User should be able to tell app when both parties found each other and met ( think like order delivered essentially: could be automatic )
- User should be able to cancel meeting request
- User can leave a comment to the other user as to why they cancelled
- User should be able to sepcify activity to engadge in ( tennis, ping pong ) during request
- App should show you "You Matched ðŸ¥³" when 2 users match
- App should show user in feed for time of request
- App should show static map location within the GIU campus with ðŸ”´ dot for inactive user and ðŸŸ¢ dot for active user
- App shoud show live location of user within campus
- App should inform user when request time is up.
- App should inform user of request cancellation
- App should be geographically locked to the premise of the GIU only

### Edge Requirements
- User can take a photo directly from the application
- User will be able to answer trivia about themselves to increase matchability with other users.

### Deligher Requirements
- More in here later ðŸ˜€
